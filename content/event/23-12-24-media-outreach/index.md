<!-- Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including page elements such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->



On December 24, CCTV News' “One Lesson Together” invited experts from the School of Astronomy and Space Science of Nanjing University to lead the exploration of the mysteries of the universe. Among them, Yao Jun, a doctoral student in the group, led a live measurement of celestial distances using the principle of trigonometric parallax measurement.
