China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is the most important space science facility for China's space station project, the largest and most advanced space astronomical telescope in China so far, and will also be one of the most important space astronomical observation instruments in the world in the next decade. 
In order to promote the comprehensive development of CSST astrometry science projects, the "China Space Station Telescope (CSST) Astrometry Scientific Project Promotion Seminar" was held. 
The content of the meeting mainly includes: 
- the results and latest progress of the completed second-class projects; 
- Research progress and results of a class of topics; 
- and the requirements of each topic for future simulation data.
