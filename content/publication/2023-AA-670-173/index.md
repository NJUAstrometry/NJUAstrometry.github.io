Pulsars provide a unique bridge between **dynamical** (planetary ephemeris–based) and **kinematic** (Gaia/VLBI) celestial reference frames. By comparing pulsar positions from timing, VLBI, and Gaia, this study estimates orientation offsets between these frames and discusses systematics driven by sample composition (MSP vs. non‑MSP) and ecliptic‑latitude selection.
