abstract: >
  For detecting exoplanets with high precision, the angular distance between two stars can be used to detect the periodic motion of a star,
  which avoids introducing catalog position errors from traditional photographic astrometry.  
  At the microarcsecond precision level, the effect of optical axis deviation becomes non-negligible.
  This study evaluates the impact of optical axis stability on relative angular-distance measurements through theoretical analysis
  and numerical simulations.  
  When the angular-distance error is limited to 1 μas, the upper limit of optical-axis deviation is found to be 68 milliarcseconds.
  The corresponding error allowance is given, and the impacts of CCD distortion and focal-length variation are discussed.
  The results provide design guidance for high-precision astrometric telescopes such as CHES.

summary: "We evaluated how optical-axis stability affects microarcsecond-level angular-distance measurements for exoplanet astrometry, finding a 68 mas stability requirement."

High-precision astrometric detection of exoplanets requires extreme control of instrumental systematics.
Tan *et al.* (2022) analyzed the **impact of optical-axis deviation** on relative angular-distance measurements
between star pairs, combining theoretical derivations with numerical simulations.  
They found that to maintain a precision of 1 μas in relative astrometry, the telescope’s optical-axis stability must be
better than **68 mas**.  
They further provided corresponding error budgets and mitigation strategies,
including field-of-view rotation to reduce distortion variations and laser-collimation systems to monitor focal-length changes.  
These results offer quantitative constraints for the optical design of space astrometric missions such as **CHES**.
