abstract: >
  We assess the astrometric quality of the AllWISE catalog and evaluate its potential
  as an **infrared celestial reference frame** in the era of Gaia. Using a sample of
  over one million cross-matched sources between AllWISE and Gaia DR3, we find that
  the residual frame rotations between the two systems are below **5 mas** in orientation
  and **0.1 mas yr⁻¹** in spin, demonstrating remarkable consistency. After correction
  for color-dependent and magnitude-dependent biases, the remaining zonal systematics
  in AllWISE positions are typically < 10 mas. These results confirm that AllWISE can
  serve as a valuable infrared extension of the Gaia optical frame for multi-wavelength
  astrometry.

summary: "AllWISE shows sub-10 mas systematics and sub-0.1 mas yr⁻¹ spin relative to Gaia DR3, making it a robust infrared celestial reference frame."

**Highlights**

- Orientation differences < 5 mas; spin < 0.1 mas yr⁻¹.  
- Zonal systematics after bias correction < 10 mas.  
- Confirms AllWISE as a viable **infrared celestial reference frame** complementary to Gaia.
