  We investigate the overall properties of the ICRF3 using Gaia DR2 as an external reference.
  Comparing VLBI positions at S/X, K, and X/Ka with optical counterparts (G < 18.7), we analyze formal errors,
  declination dependence, and global systematics via vector spherical harmonics.
  The ICRF3 S/X-frame shows improved accuracy and near–zonal-error-free behavior, consistent with Gaia-CRF2.
  K and X/Ka frames achieve high formal precision but exhibit zonal systematics, including a significant glide
  along the Z-axis (>200 μas) in X/Ka, likely due to sparse observations and southern geometry.

summary: "ICRF3 vs Gaia DR2: S/X agrees at ~30 μas globally; K and X/Ka show zonal systematics, notably a >200 μas Z-glide in X/Ka."

We compare the ICRF catalogs (ICRF1/2/3) with **Gaia DR2** using vector spherical harmonics (VSH) to characterize
global differences (rotation, glide, quadrupoles).  
The **ICRF3 S/X** catalog agrees with Gaia DR2 at the ~30 μas level globally and is nearly free of declination-dependent
(zonal) errors, reflecting improvements from southern re-observations, VCS-II updates, and modeling of Galactic aberration.  
The **K** and **X/Ka** frames reach better formal precision but show noticeable zonal terms; **X/Ka** exhibits a
>200 μas glide along Z and >100 μas quadrupole components, attributed to sparse sources and weak southern geometry.
These results emphasize the need for denser southern coverage at high frequencies to reduce zonal systematics.
