abstract: >
  The Galactic aberration (a.k.a. secular aberration drift) arises from the centripetal acceleration
  of the Solar System Barycenter around the Galactic center. It induces distance-independent apparent
  proper motions of extragalactic sources with an amplitude of ~5 μas yr⁻¹, producing a slow global spin
  and small regional distortions of celestial reference frames. Using vector spherical harmonics, the
  proper-motion field is characterized by dipolar (spheroidal) terms, and its impact propagates to
  Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP), requiring ~1 μas yr⁻¹ corrections to precession rates over decades.
  For high-precision realizations (VLBI ICRF3 and Gaia optical frames), the GA must be modeled to ensure
  a rigid, non-rotating link between radio and optical reference frames.

summary: "Review of Galactic aberration (~5 μas/yr) and its consequences for ICRF/Gaia frames and EOP (~1 μas/yr precession corrections)."

**Galactic aberration (GA)** is the apparent proper-motion field caused by the Solar System
Barycenter’s acceleration toward the Galactic center. With amplitude \(g \approx 5~\mu\mathrm{as~yr^{-1}}\),
the field drives a slow global spin of the realized reference frame depending on source distribution,
and introduces small but accumulating systematics in **EOP** (e.g., \(\sim 1~\mu\mathrm{as~yr^{-1}}\) in precession rates).
In the **ICRF3–Gaia** era, modeling GA—together with frame-rotation terms—is essential for a rigid radio–optical link.
Key formulas include the VSH description of the dipolar field and closed-form expressions for GA-induced
proper motions and frame rotation. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
